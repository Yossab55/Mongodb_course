so something wired in this lesson:
you can use a database in not create 
if you have bookstore, todo list databases
you can use test database
and you can create a collection but it really doesn't exist!


  1- show dbs = show databases show you all databases you have
  2- use "database name" -> switch to this database
  3- show collections -> shows collections inside that current 
    database
  4- help -> shows you all commands that can be used
  5- you can make a variable !
