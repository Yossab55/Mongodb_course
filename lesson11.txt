delete

tip: 
  in compass you can export your data to a json file 
  and insert them again

  so do that before you use delete methods 
  you don't want to write things again

lesson: 
  1- delete one: 
    db.collectionName.deleteOne(prop: value)
    delete one actually used with id only
    because if you have prop with same values 
    it will delete the first one only
    ex rating: 7 maybe there is two or more books with rating 7
    it will delete the first one ( ! obviously :) )
    use delete many instead

  2- deleteMany: 
    db.collectionName.deleteMany({filter})
    you can use any filter you learned with find methods

  ! warning: 
    deleteMany({}) will delete all documents be careful when using this
